                <p class="about-mountain">Mountains are some of the most awe-inspiring natural features on Earth, rising majestically from the land and often reaching into the clouds. They can be rugged and imposing or gentle and rolling, depending on their age and the forces that shaped them. Formed by tectonic activity over millions of years, mountains provide unique habitats for plants and animals, and their varied ecosystems support a vast range of biodiversity. They are often covered in thick forests.</p>

            <div class="forest">
                <p class="about-forest">Forests are lush, dynamic ecosystems that cover about a third of the Earth’s land area and are home to an extraordinary diversity of life. Composed of towering trees, dense undergrowth, and a complex web of interconnected species, forests provide essential habitats for countless animals, plants, and insects. They range from the towering rainforests of the Amazon, rich with dense foliage and vibrant wildlife, to the serene, temperate woodlands and the mystical boreal forests near the Arctic Circle..</p>

                <p class="about-waterfall">Waterfalls are some of nature’s most captivating spectacles, where rivers or streams plunge over cliffs, creating a cascade of rushing water that mesmerizes with its power and beauty. Each waterfall has its unique character, shaped by the landscape, height, and volume of water. Some are gentle, trickling over rocks, while others thunder down with immense force, sending sprays of mist into the air. The sight and sound of a waterfall can be both invigorating and calming, embodying the raw energy of nature in motion.</p>

            <p class="service-para">Nature provides an array of essential services that sustain life on Earth, often referred to as “ecosystem services.” These services can be categorized into four main types: provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting. Each one contributes uniquely to human well-being and the health of the planet.</p>
